This folder stores ALL FILES made for decap optimization. The code here is not properly organized/commented/dependencies listed.

I am hoping to organize the files later, and put the GA codes in their own folders based on the associated paper/work. 
But the code needs to be organized with explaniations for how to use it, explanation for file paths, removing deprecated stuff.

You can still download the files here and run the code, but might require additional work to figure out how everything works.
